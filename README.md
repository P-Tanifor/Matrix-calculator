# Matrix-calculator
Does various operations on matrices

Matrices have a wide range of applications in programming: they're used for digital image processing, 
graph representation and algorithms on a graph, graphic effects, applied math, statistics, and much more.

Since matrices are tables of numbers, they are usually presented in code as 2D-arrays. In this project, you will learn how to read and output matrices,
do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix.
