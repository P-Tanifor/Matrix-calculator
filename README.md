# Matrix-calculator
Does various operations on matrices

Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, 
and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

Matrices have a wide range of applications in programming: they're used for digital image processing, 
graph representation and algorithms on a graph, graphic effects, applied math, statistics, and much more.

Since matrices are tables of numbers, they are usually presented in code as 2D-arrays. In this project, you will learn how to read and output matrices,
do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix.
